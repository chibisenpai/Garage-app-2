<h1>Hello this is a project for my computer program</h1>
<h2>The problem:</h2>
<h3>City Garage in Addu city is facing difficulties in keeping the record of customers who are getting
services from the garage. So, the owner wants to have a digital repository of customers and the
service they get. Also, the repository should allow adding new customers and services, deleting
and modifying any existing records.</h3>

<h1>Execution
<h2> We will be simulating Program Development Life Cycle (PDLC)


<h2>Planning:</h2>

Making a Garage based POS system with Visual Studio and a database with Microsoft access will be the solution for this problem, Furthermore we will add a really friendly user ui that can be used by anyone, we will also add a user based login page so we can give owner more permission to add items and permission to change the database. We will try to finish the ui before <mark>6th of May 2023</mark> and the code before this Month (May)
